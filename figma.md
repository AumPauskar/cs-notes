## Layers
Just like any other multimedia suite figma has layers for diffent elements with the uppermost element being in the foreground and the lowermost element being in the background. This can be contolled from the left hand sode of the panel. 

## Elements
Any figma application is divided into different elements, whenever you click on that element the respective settings for that element pops up on the left and the right hand side of the viewing pane. On the left side of the pane a tree like structure can be seem that shows all the elements relative to one another. On the right hand side of the menubar a attribute table can be seen that shows all the properties of the current selected element. 

### Frame
The frame is the rectangular box that houses all the elements in the app. To create a new frame press `f` on the keyboard or on the menubar. Clicking `f` again will bring more options of the element, we have to select the desired viewport and be consistant on all of the frames.

## Colours
A new colour can be made into figma by either using the paint bucket tool similar to paint or another couloured rectangle can be used to paint the frame, this helps in making transparency layers. to make a painted rectangular layer, press `r` on the keyboard and carefully place it over the frame then go the colour option and fill it with the desired colour. Additionaly the colour picker can be used to copy and paste any colour from a different colour pallet.

## Thrcoordinate system and offset
Figma includes some tools to change the coordinates of certain elements with the help of the coordinate system. The element can be moved to a different section either by drag and drop or by using the coordinate offset on the right hand side panel.

## Inserting an icon
To use icons in figma just search figma icons and get a figma page, then you can just copy paste the icon in your figma file.

## Inserting an image
Similarly to inserting an icon, inserting an image is easy, just grab an image, then copy paste it to your figma file.

## Inserting a text
Press `t` to open the text mode and straight off you can begin typing. To let the image span multiple lines you can set a constraint on the width and the text automatically adjusts to the textbox.
